Small exercise made for an interview (pure js)

## How to run it
1. Start node: `node`
2. In the console, require the module (make sure you're in the root directory): `const clone = require('./')`
3. Use it: `clone({ foo: 'bar'}) // should return a copy of the object

## How to test it
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run tests: `npm test`
